<li>What Is Cloud Computing?</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.</code></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/">https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/</a>.</p>
<h4 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure:</h4>
<p>Amazon cloud computing resources are hosted in multiple locations world-wide. These locations are composed of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones. Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area. Each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.Resources aren't replicated across AWS Regions unless you do so specifically.</p>
<p>Each AWS Region is designed to be isolated from the other AWS Regions. This design achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability.</p>
<p>When you view your resources, you see only the resources that are tied to the AWS Region that you specified. This is because AWS Regions are isolated from each other, and we don't automatically replicate resources across AWS Regions.</p>
<h2 id="aws-free">AWS Free:</h2>
<p>Note that before you use any of these services, you should check whether they are eligible for the AWS Free Tier: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">https://aws.amazon.com/free</a></p>

<p>EC2,
LightSail</p>
<h3 id="ec2">EC2:</h3>
<p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It's designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.</p>
<p>Amazon EC2 presents a true virtual computing environment, and it allows you to use web service interfaces to launch instances with a variety of operating systems, load them with your custom application environment, manage your network’s access permissions, and run your image by using as many or few systems as you want.</p>
<p>EBS and EFS storage can be attached to EC2 instances</p>
<h4 id="amazon-ec2-instance-types">Amazon EC2 instance types:</h4>
<p>Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types that are optimized to fit different use cases. Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. They give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications. Each instance type includes one or more instance sizes, which allows you to scale your resources to the requirements of your target workload. Current details about available instance types are available at: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>General Purpose:These instances provide a balance of compute,memory and networking resources,and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads.These instances are ideal for applications which use these resources in equal proportions such as web servers and code repositories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compute Optimised:Compute optimised instances are ideal for compute bound applications which benefit from high performance processors.Instances belonging to this family are well suited for batch processing, dedicated gaming servers,ad server engines, machine learning inference, scientific modeling, high performance computing and other compute intensive applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory Optimised: These instances deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accelarated Computing:Accelarated Computing Instances makes use of hardware accelarators or co-processors, to perform functions such as floating point number calculations,graphic processing or data pattern matching,more efficiently than is possible from software running on CPUs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage Optimised:Storage optimised instances are designed for workloads which require high,sequential read and write access to large sets of data in local storage.They are optimised to deliver tens of thousands of low latency,random I/O operations per second to applications.</p>

<h4 id="lightsail">Lightsail:</h4>
<p>Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers, small businesses, students, and other users who need a simple virtual private server (VPS) solution. Lightsail provides developers compute, storage, and networking capacity, and it also provides capabilities to deploy and manage websites and web applications in the cloud. Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly--a virtual machine, solid state drive (SSD)-based storage, data transfer, Domain Name System (DNS) management, and a static IP--for a low, predictable monthly price.</p>
<h4 id="cidr-notation">CIDR Notation:</h4>
<p>An important concept that's used in networking on AWS is CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing. CIDR network addresses are allocated in a virtual private cloud (VPC) and in a subnet by using CIDR notation. A /16 block provides 65,536 IPv4 addresses. A /24 block provides 256 addresses.</p>
<p>CIDR calculator:
<a href="http://www.subnet-calculator.com/cidr.php">http://www.subnet-calculator.com/cidr.php</a></p>
<h3 id="virtual-private-cloud">Virtual Private Cloud:</h3>
<p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including the selection of your own IP address range, the creation of subnets, and the configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure and easy access to resources and applications. You could create up to five non-default VPCs per AWS account per Region. (See below for information about default VPCs.)</p>
<p>Details on Amazon VPC can be found here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc">https://aws.amazon.com/vpc</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Subnets
A VPC spans all the Availability Zones in the Region. After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone. When you create a subnet, you specify the CIDR block for the subnet, which is a subset of the VPC CIDR block. Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone, and it can't span Availability Zones.</p>
<p>This is an important fundamental topic, and we strongly recommend that you review the information at: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Default VPC</p>
<p>In each Region, AWS will provision a default VPC. This VPC has a /16 IPv4 CIDR address block of 172.31.0.0/16. This provides 65,536 private IPv4 addresses. In addition, there will be a /20 subnet that is created for each Availability Zone in the Region, which provides 4,096 addresses per subnet, with a few addresses reserved for AWS usage. The route table that is associated with the default VPC will have a public route, which in turn is associated with a provisioned internet gateway.</p>
<p>You can modify or delete the default VPC if you want to do so.</p>
<p>The most current details on the default VPC can be found here: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html</a></p>
<h4 id="storage">Storage</h4>
<p>RDS :Object</p>
<p>EBS:</p>
<p>Block Storage (EBS) is stored independent of EC2.When a new instance of EC2 is created the old EBS volumes can be attached to it.</p>
<p>&quot;The Elastic Volume feature of Amazon EBS allows you to dynamically increase capacity, tune performance, and change the type of live volumes with no downtime or performance impact. This allows you to easily right-size your deployment and adapt to performance changes.&quot;</p>
<p>(EBS attaches to only one EC2)</p>
<h4 id="amazon-simple-storage-service-amazon-s3">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3):</h4>
<p>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) stores data as objects within resources that are called buckets. You can store as many objects as you want within a bucket, and you can write, read, and delete objects in your bucket. Objects can be up to 5 TB in size.</p>
<p>You can control access to both the bucket and the objects (who can create, delete, and retrieve objects in the bucket for example), and view access logs for the bucket and its objects. You can also choose the AWS Region where a bucket is stored to optimize for latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements.</p>

<h4 id="elastic-load-balancing">Elastic Load Balancing:</h4>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)</a> automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.</p>
<p>ELB offers three types of load balancers that all feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security that are necessary to make your applications fault-tolerant.</p>
<p>An Application Load Balancer operates at the request level (Layer 7), routing traffic to targets--such as EC2 instances, microservices and containers--within Amazon VPC, based on the content of the request. It's ideal for the advanced load balancing of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Secure HTTP (HTTPS) traffic.</p>
<p>A Network Load Balancer operates at the connection level (Layer 4), routing connections to targets--such as Amazon EC2 instances, microservices, and containers--within Amazon VPC, based on IP protocol data. It's ideal for load-balancing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) traffic.</p>
<p>The Classic Load Balancer provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances, and it operates at both the request level and the connection level.</p>
<h4 id="auto-scaling">Auto scaling:</h4>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling">Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling</a> helps you maintain application availability, and it allows you to dynamically scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions that you define. You can use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling for fleet management of Amazon EC2 instances, which can help maintain the health and availability of your fleet, and ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances. You can also use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to dynamically scale Amazon EC2 instances. Dynamic scaling automatically increases the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls, which can help reduce costs. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is well-suited to applications that have stable demand patterns, or applications that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage.</p>

<h4 id="securing-amazon-ec2-instances">Securing Amazon EC2 Instances</h4>
<p>The process for securing EC2 instances involves principles that are applicable to any OS, whether running in a virtual machine or on premises:</p>
<p>Least Access: Restrict server access from both the network and on the instance, install only the required OS components and applications, and leverage host-based protection software.</p>
<p>Least Privilege: Define the minimum set of privileges each server needs in order to perform its function.
Configuration Management: Create a baseline server configuration and track each server as a configuration item. Assess each server against the current recorded baseline to identify and flag any deviations. Ensure each server is configured to generate and securely store appropriate log and audit data.</p>
<p>Change Management: Create processes to control changes to server configuration baselines.</p>
<p>Audit Logs: Audit access and all changes to EC2 instances to verify server integrity to ensure only authorized changes are made.</p>

It is a fully managed cloud database and supports both document and key-value store models. Its flexible data model, reliable performance, and automatic scaling of throughput capacity make it a great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and many other applications. Pricing for DynamoDB includes a non-expiring free tier allotment. AWS Identity and Access Management</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. We typically use credentials from IAM Users or IAM Roles to authenticate with AWS when making API calls. We control the permissions for which API actions those Users or Roles can perform with IAM Policies.</p>
<p>An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. Unlike an IAM user, A role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.</p>
<p>IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional charge. You will be charged only for use of other AWS services by your users. Detailed information about AWS IAM can be found in the documentation.</p>
<h4 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">AWS Lambda</a> lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.</p>
<p>Because your code is only running on-demand, in order to troubleshoot, you'll need to take advantage of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/troubleshooting.html">monitoring</a>. You can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions.html">troubleshoot Lambda with Amazon Cloudwatch</a> and also <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-x-ray.html">troubleshoot Lambda with AWS X-Ray</a>.</p>
<p>With Lambda, there are <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html">2 types of permissions</a> to be aware of. First, your code running in a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role">Lambda function is granted permissions by using an IAM Role</a>. Second, the service triggering your Lambda function can be granted the permissions to do so with a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#intro-permission-model-access-policy">Lambda Function Policy</a>. When configuring triggers using the AWS Management Console, the console will create the necessary Lambda Function Policy for you when you enable the trigger.</p>
<p>If you want more details about what's available to your code as it runs inside AWS Lambda, you can find out more about the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/current-supported-versions.html">Lambda execution environment</a> in the documentation.</p>
