#### Getting started

You can start a project by running CRA with npx - `sudo npx create-react-app project-name`, by doing this you won't have to install create-react-app globally.
(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher)

If you use npm 5.1 or earlier, you can't use `npx`. Instead, install `create-react-app` globally:

`npm install -g create-react-app
`

Now you can run:

`create-react-app my-app`
